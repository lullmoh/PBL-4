        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Hi! I'm Lull Mohamud, and I am excited to welcome you to my Programming Timeline. This website is a look back at my programming journey so far. Over the last three years, I've picked up new skills, built cool projects, and learned a lot from my mistakes. This webpage shows my growth—from the basics I've acquirred over the years, to the projects I've completed.

                <h3>Pre-Highschool</h3>
                <p>To be honest, before highschool, I wasn't really interested in coding. But then again, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do at all. The only coding experience I had before highschool was in sixth grade when I was admitted into the Girls Who Code Club at my school along with my Technology Class. I wasn't sure why I was chosen to be in this club, but I know that it changed my views on coding. We coded mainly through Scratch and Code.org.</p>

                <h3>Year One</h3>
                <p>My freshman year of highschool, I took Ms. Pathan's Programming Class. In this class, I was taught the basics and of the main programming languages, we worked with Java. During this school year, I picked up GWC again, and thanks to Ms. Pathan, we were able to compete in a CGI Girls Tech Competition. Fadumo Awil, Rayan Amin, one of our TA's, and I placed second runner-up and won an $8000 scholarship!</p>

                <h3>Year Two</h3>
                <p>My sophmore year of highschool, I took Mr. Dal's Object-Oriented Programming Class. In this class, I was introduced to Python, another programming language. We worked with Replit (Python), and created various projects through Code.Org. Additionally, I was in Mr. Dal's CoderZ group. CoderZ is an onlne platform in which students engage in interactive missions, coding their way out of problems. I was also in GWC this year as well, focusing on coding through Scratch.</p>

        <div id = "yearThree">
                <h3>Year Three</h3>
                <p>My junior year of highschool, this year, I am taking Ms. Pathan's Web Design Class, and Mr. Dursun Caliskan's Math for Computer Science Class. In Ms. Pathan's class, I learned how to code with HTML through Visual Studio Code, and in Mr. Caliskan's class, I learned how to code with JavaScript through p5.js. This was my first year competing in the Codeathon competition. I am also GWC's secretary this year, teaching some of our fellow students how to code.</p>
